### Text

GitHub Actions is automation inside GitHub. A workflow file says: when something happens, run these commands on a GitHub machine.

Minimal CI workflow:

```yaml
name: CI

on:
  pull_request:
  push:
    branches: [main]

jobs:
  check:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - uses: actions/checkout@v4
      - run: npm ci
      - run: npm test
      - run: npm run build
```

Do not memorize YAML. Learn how to read the structure.
